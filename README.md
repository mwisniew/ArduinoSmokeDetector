# ArduinoSmokeDetector
Smoke detector based on Arduino
This is a smoke detector based on MH - MQ Flying Fish sensor and a buzzer.

Sensor pins (sensor pin -> arduino pin - I/O):
  - A0 -> A5 - analog input
  - GND -> GND - grounding
  - VCC -> 5V - voltage

Buzzer pins:
  - (+) -> D8 - digital output
  - (-) -> GND - grounding
  
Use resistors at will.
