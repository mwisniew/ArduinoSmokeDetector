# ArduinoSmokeDetector
Smoke detector based on Arduino
This is the smoke detector based on MH - MQ Flying Gish sensor and a buzzer.

Sensor pins (sensor pin -> arduino pin - I/O):
  - A0 -> A5 - amalog input
  - GND -> GND - grounding
  - VCC -> 5V - voltage

Buzzer pins:
  - + -> D8 - digital output
  - - -> GND - grounding
  
Use resistors at will.
